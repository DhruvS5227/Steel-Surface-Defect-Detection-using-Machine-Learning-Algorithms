# Steel-Surface-Defect-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Analysis into the factors responsible for faulty steel surface during the manufacturing process will enable the manufacturer to identify the issue in the steel early which saves lots of money.
The core of this analysis will involve identifying the factors and classifying the faults in steel plates using  Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN.
